        <h3>Location is Key</h3>
        <p>Here are three easy tips for choosing the perfect location for your new garden.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Most fruits and vegetables need 6 to 8 hours of sunlight daily. Observe your yard throughout the day to find the sunniest spot. Avoid areas heavily shaded by trees, buildings, or fences.</li>
              <li>Choose a spot with well-draining soil. No standing pools of water after a rain. Make sure it is not too sandy or clay-heavy. You might need to improve it with compost.</li>
              <li>Make sure your garden is near a convenient water source. Lugging watering cans across the yard can get old fast! Having easy access to a hose or irrigation system will make maintenance easier.</li>
            </ol>
